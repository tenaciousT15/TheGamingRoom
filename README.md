# TheGamingRoom
CS 230 Portfolio

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room currently has a game available to Android users only. The client wants the game software, Draw It or Lose It, to be developed as a web-based game that serves multiple platforms. The game requires images from a large library to be loaded for the user to access. The game software will also be required to allow for an expanse of games, users, and teams with unique respective identifiers. Only one game with their specific identifier can exist at one time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The recommendations portion of the desing documentation was completed well for this documentation. The operating platforms, system architectures, storage and memory management, and security were thoroughly researched to be able to provide the best recommendation to suit the client's requirements. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document as a whole was very helpful. It served as a sort of outline to ensure all the client's requirements were met. Having a design document ensured everything that was a necessity to The Gaming Room was researched and discussed. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part of this design documet that I would revise would be the table data. Some information seemed scattered or not in alignment to be able to compare with other platforms. I would ensure the data listed was comparable to one another. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user can expect to have optimal performance with speed, memory management, user-friendly interface, and the ability to use the game software on various platforms for online play. I recommended the most versatile operating system with access to plenty of cross-platform tools and support. Storage and memory are able to pull the most frequently used images quickly and automatically delete unused data, keeping the software clean. The use of distributed systems and networks enables the user to access the game wherever internet is available. And ensuring the user's data is secure by using encyrption and appropriate authentication is vital for the safety of the user. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Using the design template was the best approach to designing this software. The objective was clear, the client's requirements were listed, the OOP principles were laid out, the various platforms were compared with one another, and a recommendation based on those findings was made. In the future, I would use a similar design template to ensure all necessary topics are covered.
